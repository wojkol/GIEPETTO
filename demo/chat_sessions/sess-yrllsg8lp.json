Exhaust gases from the engine exit through the exhaust manifold and enter the turbocharger turbine. <br>\n2. The turbine spins and powers the compressor.<br>\n3. The compressor pulls in ambient air and compresses it, which raises the air\u2019s density (more oxygen molecules are inside each cubic foot of air).<br>\n4. The compressed air is then pushed into the engine\u2019s intake manifold, sometimes after being cooled through an intercooler.<br>\n5. With more air, more fuel can be added to the mixture, leading to more power from each engine stroke.<br>\n\n<b>Benefits of Using a Turbocharger:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Increased power output:</b> Allows smaller engines to produce more power, similar to that of a larger engine.</li>\n  <li><b>Improved efficiency:</b> Helps in burning fuel more efficiently, which can improve fuel economy.</li>\n  <li><b>Reduced emissions:</b> Efficient burning also means fewer emissions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Common Applications:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Automobiles (especially in performance and passenger cars)</li>\n  <li>Trucks</li>\n  <li>Aircraft</li>\n  <li>Construction and farm machinery</li>\n  <li>Power generation equipment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Maintenance Tips:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Regular oil changes to ensure proper lubrication of the turbo system.</li>\n  <li>Let the engine idle for a short period before turning it off, especially after high-speed runs.</li>\n  <li>Regular checks for leaks or blockages in the air intake system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Performance Enhancements with Aftermarket Turbos:</b><br>\nAftermarket turbo kits can significantly increase an engine\u2019s horsepower and torque. When considering enhancements, you should also consider upgrading other parts of the engine to handle the increased stress and power.\n\nHope this gives you a clear understanding of how turbochargers work and why they are beneficial! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. \u2699\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8"

Here's a reformatted explanation incorporating a table to better illustrate some points about turbochargers. \ud83d\ude05\n\n<b>Introduction to Turbochargers</b><br>\nA turbocharger, often known as a turbo, enhances an engine's efficiency and power output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber.\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Component</th>\n    <th>Function</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Turbine</td>\n    <td>Extracts energy from the engine's exhaust gases</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Compressor</td>\n    <td>Compresses air and delivers it to the engine's intake</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Bearing system</td>\n    <td>Supports the spinning shaft that connects turbine and compressor</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Intercooler</td>\n    <td>Cools the compressed air before it enters the engine</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<b>How It Works:</b><br>\n<ol>\n  <li>Exhaust gases leave the engine and enter the turbine, causing it to spin.</li>\n  <li>This rotation drives the compressor, which pulls in and compresses air.</li>\n  <li>The compressed air is possibly cooled by an intercooler then released into the engine\u2019s intake manifold.</li>\n  <li>The additional air allows for more fuel to be combusted, boosting engine output.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<b>Advantages of Turbocharging:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Power:</b> Increases engine power without needing a larger engine.</li>\n  <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Improves overall fuel economy and reduces emissions.</li>\n  <li><b>Emissions:</b> Helps achieve lower emissions by burning fuel more completely.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Typical Applications:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Automobiles (in performance cars and compact city cars)</li>\n  <li>Trucks and heavy equipment</li>\n  <li>Aircraft</li>\n  <li>Power generation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Maintenance Essentials and Performance Tips:</b><br>\nMaintaining turbocharged engines involves regular oil changes, allowing engines to idle after running, and checking for any leaks or blockages in air intake systems.\n\nFor those desiring more power, aftermarket turbo kits are available, but ensure other engine components are upgraded to handle the extra stress.\n\nHope this helps, and sorry for missing out on the table before!
