Here are some intriguing facts about turbochargers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Turbochargers were originally developed to increase the power output and efficiency of aircraft engines during World War I.</li>\n  <li>A turbo can significantly improve an engine's horsepower without increasing its weight, which is why it\u2019s particularly popular in racing and performance vehicles.</li>\n  <li>The principle behind turbocharging is to reuse the engine\u2019s exhaust flow to spin a turbine, which then drives a compressor, which increases the amount of incoming air and effectively boosts engine power.</li>\n  <li>Modern turbochargers can spin at speeds of up to 250,000 RPM, which is up to 30 times faster than the average car engine rotates.</li>\n  <li>While traditionally associated with high-performance cars, turbochargers are also used to improve fuel efficiency in economy models, reducing fuel consumption by around 20-40% in diesel engines and 10-20% in gasoline engines.</li>\n</ul>"
