        "content": "To install a DHCP server on a Linux system using the command line interface, you'll need to follow a series of steps depending on the distribution of Linux you are using. Here's a generic guide to help you get set up:\n\n### For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):\n\n1. **Update your package list:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the DHCP server package:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure the DHCP server:**\n   - Edit the configuration file found at `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. You will need to define the range of IP addresses the DHCP server should allocate to clients, among other settings.\n   - Example configuration:\n     ```\n     subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n       range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.100;\n       option domain-name-servers ns1.example.org, ns2.example.org;\n       option domain-name \"yourdomain.example\";\n       option routers 192.168.1.1;\n       default-lease-time 600;\n       max-lease-time 7200;\n     }\n     ```\n\n4. **Assign the correct interface:**\n   - Edit `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server` to set the `INTERFACESv4` variable to the network interface you want the DHCP server to serve.\n     ```bash\n     INTERFACESv4=\"eth0\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Start the DHCP server:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server\n   ```\n\n6. **Enable the DHCP server to start at boot:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server\n   ```\n\n### For Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS):\n\n1. **Install the DHCP server package:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install dhcp\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure the DHCP server:**\n   - Edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` similarly to how you would for a Debian-based system.\n\n3. **Start and enable the DHCP service:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl start dhcpd\n   sudo systemctl enable dhcpd\n   ```\n\n4. **Firewall configuration (if needed):**\n   - For systems with firewalls enabled, make sure to open the DHCP server's port:\n     ```bash\n     sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent\n     sudo firewall-cmd --reload\n     ```\n\n### Check DHCP Server Status:\nTo check the status of your DHCP server:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server  # For Debian-based systems\nsudo systemctl status dhcpd            # For Red Hat-based systems\n```\n\n### Note:\n- Make sure to replace `eth0` with the correct network interface identifier for your system.\n- Adjust IP addresses and other network settings according to your network\u2019s configuration requirements.\n\nThis should give you a basic DHCP server setup. You might want to customize it further based on your specific needs and network environment."
