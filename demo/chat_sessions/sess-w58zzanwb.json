As the turbine spins, so does the compressor.</li>\n<li><strong>Compression of Air:</strong> The compressor draws in and compresses air, which it then pushes into the engine. With more air, more fuel can be added, thus increasing the power output.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Advantages of Turbocharged Engines</h2>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th style=\"color: green;\">Advantages</th>\n    <th style=\"color: red;\">Disadvantages</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Increased power output</td>\n    <td>Initial cost can be high</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Improved efficiency</td>\n    <td>Can increase engine wear</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reduced emissions</td>\n    <td>Potential for turbo lag</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Types of Turbos</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Single Turbo:</strong> Offers good balance between boost and responsiveness. Common in inline-four and V6 engines.</li>\n<li><strong>Twin-Turbo:</strong> Utilizes two turbos either sequentially or in parallel to provide more power and eliminate lag.</li>\n<li><strong>Variable Geometry Turbo:</strong> Uses vanes to adjust the flow at different engine speeds, reducing lag without compromising power.</li>\n<li><strong>Twin Scroll Turbo:</strong> Divides the exhaust flow into two streams that enter the turbine separately, improving efficiency at low engine speeds.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>\n<ul style=\"color: blue;\">\n<li>Regularly check for oil leaks.</li>\n<li>Ensure the air filter is clean for optimum air intake.</li>\n<li>Let your engine idle for a short period before turning it off, especially after driving fast.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Understanding and maintaining your turbo can significantly enhance engine performance, ensuring you get the most out of your turbocharged vehicle!</em></p>"
