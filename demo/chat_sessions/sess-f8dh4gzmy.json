For example:\n   ```bash\n   cd path/to/your/project\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize the local directory as a Git repository:**<br>\n   If you haven't already initialized your repo:\n   ```bash\n   git init\n   ```\n\n4. **Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit:**<br>\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   ```\n   This command adds all the files to the staging area. For specific files, replace `.` with the file names.\n\n5. **Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository:**<br>\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"First commit\"\n   ```\n   Replace `\"First commit\"` with a meaningful commit message.\n\n6. **At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click to copy the remote repository URL.**\n\n7. **Add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:**<br>\n   ```bash\n   git remote add origin <remote repository URL>\n   ```\n   Replace `<remote repository URL>` with the URL you copied earlier.\n\n8. **Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub:**<br>\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin master\n   ```\n   Replace `master` with the branch you want to push to, if you're not using `master`.\n\nThat's it! \ud83c\udf1f You've successfully pushed your local repository to GitHub using the Linux CLI. Remember, if you have any authentication issues, you may need to set up your SSH key or use HTTPS and provide your GitHub credentials."
